# About me 
  Hi, I'm Yeren.
  I'm currently learning machine learning, focusing primarily on fundamentals such as Pytorch, numpy and core algorithms. Once my school workload lightens, I plan to work on small projects, such as a recommendation system and an image classification model â€” specifically focused   on medieval weapons to   practice.
  Outside of machine learning and programming I do fencing, archery and hiking on my free time. I am still a beginner in these hobbies, but I enjoy them greatly. 
  You can reach me through my phone number or telegram.

  Languages: Python (stronger), C++ (stronger), C#, JavaScript

  Frameworks/Libraries: Django, PyTorch, NumPy
